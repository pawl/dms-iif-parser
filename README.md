dms-iif-parser
============

This project changes IIF files from Paypal based on rules and gets them ready for import into Quickbooks.
* It can correct the issue with the "CLASS" column being ignored by Quickbooks (the class needs to be added to the appropriate split)
* It can also change the "ACCOUNT" or "MEMO" column when based on your rules.

Project is based on the Flask-Bootstrap-Skel template and is built to be used on Heroku.
